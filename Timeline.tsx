// This file contained invalid syntax ('full contents of Timeline.tsx') and was causing build errors.
// It has been updated to re-export the main Timeline component from its correct location
// at './components/Timeline.tsx'. This resolves the syntax error without altering the
// existing project structure or creating duplicate code.
import Timeline from './components/Timeline';
export default Timeline;
